# First Person Citizen Control Rig v0.1

Use only with the latest version of Blender.

Please read this [page](https://wiki.facepunch.com/sbox/Citizen_Model) and this [page](https://wiki.facepunch.com/sbox/First_Person) in order to understand better how the vmdl-first_person_citizen.vmdl works.

This control rig drives the already existing skeleton from the vmdl-first_person_citizen.vmdl file provided inside this package. Once the twist bones are configured inside Blender, all animations will look the same as they do in ModelDoc.
