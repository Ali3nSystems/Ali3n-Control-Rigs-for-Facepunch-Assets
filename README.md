# Ali3n Control Rigs for Facepunch Assets

## Huge thank you to Setherizor for making a custom addon that automates the action export.

* Export Helper Addon: https://gitlab.com/setherizor/blender-export-helper
* Check the documentation to find out more about this addon.
* Make sure you use the latest Blender version and it is extremely recommended to use the latest version of the "Better Fbx Importer & Exporter" addon, otherwise you might get funny bone transforms.

## Contact

* If you have any feedback or would like to contact me, please DM me on discord eEight#4035.
